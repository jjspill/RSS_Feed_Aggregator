    <summary type="html">The candidate running for re-election offers truth. This is what I did, I would like to do it again. The candidate coming out of nowhere offers hope. We can&amp;#8217;t know but we can imagine. Kickstarter offers hope. No reviews, no tests, simply a promise of what might be. Book publishers buy hope, so do venture [&amp;#8230;]</summary>

    <title>The low-stakes argument</title>

    <summary type="html">It&amp;#8217;s tempting and fun to argue about the logo. About the way the toilet paper is hung. About how to load the trunk of the car. These sorts of arguments work precisely because they don&amp;#8217;t matter. At all. And they distract us from the incredibly difficult work of discussing the things that actually do matter.

    <summary type="html">Magicians know where the trapdoors are, what&amp;#8217;s up their sleeves and how to hide the ball. And yet, mechanical skill is just the first step in being actually good at magic. The real skill is in finding the empathy to imagine that someone else might believe. To do the trick for them, not to them.</summary>

    <summary type="html">At the dawn of the plastic age, it was a cheap substitute. The word &amp;#8220;plasticky&amp;#8221; is not a compliment.

    <summary type="html">Some fields of endeavor continue to narrow down the unknown, in search of the recipe, the efficient method of industry. And others live on Feynman&amp;#8217;s expanding frontier of ignorance, where each closed door leads to several newly opened ones. That&amp;#8217;s a fundamental choice in our work.

    <summary type="html">There&amp;#8217;s a difference between intellectual and smart. A plumber is smart, they know how to do a skilled and effective job on the task at hand. Intellectualism isn&amp;#8217;t about practical results, it&amp;#8217;s a passion for exploring what others have said, though this approach is sometimes misused to make others feel uninformed or to stall.
