    <title>Review: 'Barry' takes a whack at its farewell season</title>
    <published>2023-04-14T12:33:08+00:00</published>

    <summary type="html">&quot;Barry&quot; has taken chances from the very beginning, which is certainly true of a fourth and final season that picks up where the third left off, with its hitman-turned-wannabe actor getting arrested. That paves the way for an even darker season that accentuates the show's ensemble aspect while leaning a little too heavily on blurring lines with flights of fancy.</summary>
